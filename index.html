<p class="intro"> Depression is a disorder that is heavily stigmatized and underreported. It is very important to let ourselves know that it is alright to feel as if your world is falling apart into bits and pieces, because it so often does. We attach so much of shame and fear to mental illnesses, that the pain accentuates and multiplies over time. Finding mental health-care is tough and challenging, but one still has to try. As cliche as it may sound, the moment you begin talking to a therapist, it gets easier. It may take a whole lifetime of a journey before one is actually able to believe that, but the moment when one does, it gets easier from there.</p>
